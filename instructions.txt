Here is one cookbook way to install and run Eudora_fix_mbx.
Obviously there are lots of possible variations.

To install:

1. Go to https://github.com/LenShustek/Eudora_fix_mbx.
   Click on the filename "Eudora_fix_mbx.exe".
   Click on "Download", which is towards the right.
   Your goal is to have the file be in the directory with your Eudora mailboxes,
   which Eudora shows in the "Help" "About Eudora" window after "Data:".
   * If your browser is set to "ask where to save", 
     navigate to that directory and click on "Save".
   * If your browser automatically saves files in some fixed place like "Downloads",
     you will have to move or copy the file from there to the mailbox directory.

 2. Go to https://github.com/LenShustek/Eudora_fix_mbx.
    Click on the filename "translations.txt".
    Click on "Raw" towards the right.
    Right click in the window, then click on "Save as..." or "Save page as..."
    Navigate to the mailbox directory and click on "Save".
 
 3. Repeat step 2 for the file "fix_mbx.bat", making sure that the 
    saved file doesn't get ".txt" appended by your browser.
 
 To run:
 
 1. Stop Eudora.
 
 2. Run the Windows File Explorer.
    Navigate to where your Eudora mailboxes are.
    Doubleclick on "fix_mbx.bat". 
    (The ".bat" may not show, depending on what options you have set.)
    Enter the name of the mailbox you wish to fix, without the .mbx extension.
    Check for errors, then press space.
    
 3. Restart Eudora.
