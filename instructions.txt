Here are some cookbook ideas for installing and running Eudora_fix_mbx.
Obviously there are lots of possible variations.

The installation goal is to put three files
   Eudora_fix_mbx.exe
   translations.txt
   fix_mbx.bat
into the directory with your Eudora mailboxes. You can see where that is
in the "Help" "About Eudora" window, after "Data:".

To install using the ZIP file:

   Go to https://github.com/LenShustek/Eudora_fix_mbx.
   Cick on the green "Code" button and choose "Download ZIP".
   Unzip the file and copy those three files to your mailbox directory.
   
To install without dealing with a ZIP file:

   1. Go to https://github.com/LenShustek/Eudora_fix_mbx.
      Click on the filename "Eudora_fix_mbx.exe".
      Click on "Download", which is towards the right.
      * If your browser is set to "ask where to save", 
        navigate to the mailbox directory and click on "Save".
      * If your browser automatically saves files in some fixed place like "Downloads",
        move or copy the file from there to the mailbox directory.

    2. Go to https://github.com/LenShustek/Eudora_fix_mbx.
       Click on the filename "translations.txt".
       Click on "Raw" towards the right.
       Right click in the window, then click on "Save as..." or "Save page as..."
       Navigate to the mailbox directory and click on "Save".
    
    3. Repeat step 2 for the file "fix_mbx.bat", making sure that the 
       saved file doesn't get ".txt" appended by your browser.
 
 To run

    Make sure the mailbox(es) you wish to fix are not open in Eudora.
    Using the Windows File Explorer, navigate to where your Eudora mailboxes are.
    Doubleclick on "fix_mbx.bat" (or "fix_mbx")
    Enter the name of the mailbox you wish to fix, without the .mbx extension.
      (If the name has embedded spaces, enclose it in quotes: "My mailbox".)
    
    - If there are errors, the batch file will pause for you to review them.
    - Five previous backups of the mailbox file are kept. If no changes are
      made to the mailbox when you run the program, a new backup is not created.
    - There is a log kept in Eudora_fix_mbx.log. The oldest entries are
      removed when the log file becomes bigger than 1MB.
    - If you create a shortcut to the batch file on your desktop, you can run
      it by just doing a drag-and-drop of the mailbox file onto it.
