This patched version of Eudora.exe fixes the problem with incoming 
Outlook-generated email whose suggested filename for attachments is long 
and split into multiple lines. Without the patch, Eudora only uses the 
first part of the name. 

For details, see truncated_filename_fixes.txt.

As always, be cautious when using a patched version of any software. Backup, 
backup, backup!
