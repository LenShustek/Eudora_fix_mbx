;translations_ASCII.txt: version of 10/23/2021 at 9:41pm
;A file for the Eudora_fix_mbx program (version 1.0 or higher) that describes replacements
;for common Unicode (UTF-8) codes and other sequences that Eudora doesn't display correctly.

;This version translates into only the standard ASCII characters from hex 00 to hex 7F, which
;  makes some of the replacements fairly cryptic. To use it, rename it to translations.txt.
;For a version that translates into the Windows-1252 extended ASCII character set,
;  which Eudora does seem to display correctly, use the supplied translations.txt.

;By default we allow Eudora to be running when fixing non-system mailboxes -- which should
;be closed -- but not when fixing In, Out, Trash, or Junk. If you don't want Eudora running
;at all when fixing mailboxes, uncomment the following line by removing the first semicolon:
;options noeudora   ;never fix any mailboxes if Eudora is running

;If you are running this on a very large mailbox and know that changes only need to be made
;near the end, you can restrict replacements and speed things up by uncommenting this line:
;options onlydo 10 MB  ;only scan the last chunk of very large mailboxes

;By default we do replacements in the address and the subject fields of the
;table-of-contents file. You can choose not do that that by uncommenting this line:
;options skiptoc  ;don't make changes in the table-of-contents file

;Replace UTF-8 hex codes corresponding to Windows-1252 codes 80 to 9F

;Appendix: Here are some ideas for dealing with Emojis and other Unicode graphics.
; You can "uncomment" and activate the replacement rules by removing the initial semicolon.

; There are over 3000 Unicode emojis that are encoded using 3 or 4 bytes, so it is hopeless to
; try to deal with them all. Eudora knows how to display 34 of them encoded as "emoticon" ASCII 
; character sequences, but only in the body of messages, not in subject lines, and only if not 
; preceded or followed by an alphabetic or numeric character unless it is from another emoticon. 
; It displays the images that are in Eudora directories Emoticons, Emoticons24, or Emoticons32.
; When you send, reply, or forward the message, they are sent as the ASCII sequences unless you
; have set <X-Eudora-Option:SendEmoticonsAsImages=1>, in which case they are sent as images.
; If you send them as ASCII, most mail clients other than Eudora (Gmail, Outlook, and Roundcube, 
; for example) will not display the emojis even though they would have if they were UTF-8 encoded.

;If you are happy with Eudora's behavior for emoticons, here are two easy cases to try by uncommenting.
;(The replacements are in pieces only so Eudora doesn't show them as graphics if this file is emailed!) 
;E298B9 = ":-" "("   ;sad face
;E298BA = ":-" ")"   ;smiley face
;You can add more. In Eudora's Emoticon image directories, the characters before the space in the
;name are the ASCII character sequences it looks for, with !xx representing a character code in hex.
;The list of official Unicode Emojis you could translate is here: https://unicode-table.com/en/emoji/.

;Instead of doing the the codes one at a time, you could specify blocks of 64
;3-byte Unicode characters at a time with rules like this:
;E298 !00 = "(O)"      ;replace Unicode graphics codes U+2600 through U+263F with (O)
;E299 !00 = "(O)"      ;replace Unicode graphics codes U+2640 through U+267F with (O)

;Here's an even bigger group of 4096 Unicode emoji-like pictograms, 
;all of which are displayed in Eudora as four weird characters:
;F09F !00 !00 = "(O)"  ;replace Unicode graphics codes U+1F000 through U+1FFFF with (O)

;Remember that if you specify those block translations, the message forever loses
;any encoding of what the specific original graphic was.
